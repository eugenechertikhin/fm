# File Manager 

This project innitiated because *Midnight commanger* stall in its development. But sometimes I found it usefull.

It should be very lightweight application with minimal dependencies, easy to compile 
and porting to different unix-like systems (microsoft windows also might be supported).

Different things to start this development is refresh my c++ knoweledge.
